# Full-Stack Application Development with MySQL, React, and Node.js

## Project Overview
In this exercise, you will develop a complete full-stack application using MySQL for the database, Node.js for the backend, and React for the frontend. Working in teams of 2-3 students, you'll design and implement a database-driven application on a topic of your choice.

## Project Topics
Choose one of the following topics for your application:

1. **Music Festival Management** - Track artists, stages, performance schedules, and ticket sales
2. **Fantasy Sports League** - Manage teams, players, matches, and statistics
3. **Food Delivery Service** - Handle restaurants, menus, orders, and delivery drivers
4. **Travel Planner** - Organize destinations, accommodations, activities, and user itineraries
5. **Indie Game Review Platform** - Track games, developers, user reviews, and ratings
6. **Sneaker Marketplace** - Manage inventory, sales, users, and wishlists
7. **Craft Beer Database** - Store breweries, beer types, ratings, and user preferences
8. **Podcast Directory** - Organize podcasts, episodes, hosts, and listener reviews
9. **Fitness Challenge App** - Track workouts, achievements, user progress, and leaderboards
10. **Local Event Discovery** - Manage venues, events, categories, and user attendance

Teams may propose an alternative topic, subject to instructor approval.

## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Team Formation and Subject Selection
- Form teams of 2-3 members
- Select a topic from the provided list or propose your own
- Quickly outline your application concept
- **Deliverable**: Brief project proposal with team member names and chosen topic

### Stage 2: Database Design
- Design your database schema with proper entity relationships
- Include multiple tables with appropriate join relationships
- Identify primary and foreign keys
- Create a simple ER diagram
- **Deliverable**: Basic ER diagram for instructor approval

### Stage 3: MySQL Implementation
- Create the database in MySQL Workbench
- Write SQL scripts for table creation
- Implement basic constraints and relationships
- Add sample data (3-5 records per table)
- **Deliverable**: SQL scripts for database creation and sample data

### Stage 4: Backend Development
- Set up a Node.js/Express server
- Create essential API endpoints
- Connect to MySQL database
- Focus on core functionality
- **Deliverable**: Basic working Node.js backend

### Stage 5: Frontend Development
- Create a React application with key components
- Implement basic UI for database interaction
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Focus on core functionality over design
- **Deliverable**: Working React frontend application

### Stage 6: Final Integration and Presentation
- Ensure basic end-to-end functionality
- Prepare a brief demonstration
- Present the working application (5 minutes)
- **Deliverable**: Working application and short presentation

## Evaluation Criteria
