1. useState: 
For button 1, we set the state to False. For button 2, we also set the state to False.

2. if/else for the buttons: 
Button 1 starts with a state of False. When button 1 is clicked, its state changes to True and button 2's state changes to False. 
The same goes for button 2: it starts with a state of False, and when clicked, its state changes to True and button 1's state changes to False.

3. onClick: 
We will execute the relevant action for each button. When button 1 is clicked, the action defined for button 1 will be executed. When button 2 is clicked, its action will be executed, and the states will be updated accordingly.
